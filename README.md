# Project Name: QuickLab

**# Inspiration behind our project**
This project has been inspired by two secondary students. One of the students is privileged and gets to attend a school with well-equipped laboratories and the second girl attends an under-resourced school with less laboratory equipment. At the end of the year, both the students are expected to sit for the same national examination and pass with good grades, which is merely impossible for the second girl.
**# Project Description**
This project is a Virtual laboratory that aims to give equity to secondary school students by increasing access to frequent science practical sessions. It will be built and Inspired by Akirachix Software Engineering students based on the problems secondary students face while trying to access lab equipment in the science practicals.
Students that are successful in enrolling in underfunded schools with large student populations find it difficult to conduct frequent practical sessions due to limited facilities and laboratories, which results in poor performance of the science subjects.
The aim of Cheche is to ensure that all students have access to science laboratories so as to boost their performance.
With the revolutionary world, we decided to use real-time 3D simulations in making models that will help the online practicals be more interactive for students. This ensures that the sessions are memorable, real-time, interactive, readily available(Both online and offline), and more affordable.
**# Users of the system**
The system is used by Student and Teachers.
